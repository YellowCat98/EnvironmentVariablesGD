# Environment Variables

- Self explanatory.
- An API mod for other developers to use environment variables for their mods.

## Note!
- Environment variables are confined within the game and cannot be accessed outside of it (any mod may access any environment variable set)
- This mod is meant to be used by developers, this mod does nothing on its own.

### Environment variables that are already set by default:
- `GD_VERSION`: GD Version
- `GEODE_VERSION`: Geode Version
- `ENV_VARS_VERSION`: This mod's version.

- (Documentation are in https://github.com/YellowCat98/environmentvariables)
